# Forecasting tool

This is a project made to graduate from Gda≈Ñsk University with master's degree.

Master's thesis: Construction of a forecasting tool for forecasting stock levels based on the sales data using the Python programming language.

AutoARIMA model only accepts univariate time series, loop took around 30 minutes.

N-BEATS model accepts multivariate time series, but I didn't have a possibility to use GPU. It was necessary to use a loop for each product, so it took around 11.5 hours.

Prophet model accepts only univariate time series, same as AutoARIMA model, but it can also include country holidays. Loop took around 12 minutes and is very similar to AutoARIMA loop, so it is around 3 times faster including saving csv file after each prediction made.
